The Cyclistic marketing department is developing a strategy for converting casual riders to annual members (subscribers). The analytic goals of this project are to <b> understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently and <i>why</i> casual riders might join the platform</b>. As part of their strategy, the marketing team seeks advice on using digital media to influence conversions. 

For the full detailed analysis with code, see finalcode.md. Note that cyclistic_r.Rproj is a reproducible project in RStudio.

# Executive Summary of Recommendations

Here are the recommendations <b>in priority order</b>:

1. Require e-mail sign-ups to track user journeys so that we can uncover behavior patterns and drive conversions from causal riders to annual members.

2. Modify <b>key performance metrics</b> to include number of trips/rides by casual riders vs annual members/subscribers based on geospatial, hourly, and seasonal trends, due to <b>observed differences that can aid in persona development</b>.

3. Tailor marketing campaigns based on customer type (casual rider vs annual member), season of the year, hourly trends, and locations. 

<b><font color="blue"> The following sections contain expanded insights/recommendations based on daily, hourly, and seasonal usage of Cyclistic bikes</b></font>: 

# Monitor Cyclistic user journeys using e-mail sign-ups

The greatest number of rides for both casual riders and annual members are registered over the summer. There is a ~5% increase in workday monthly rides from Jul-Sep for annual members, but a ~16% decrease in casual rides over the same seasonal period. See graph below.

<i>This trend inspires us to wonder whether there is a conversion of casual riders taking place. To validate this claim, I recommend tracking user journeys in the Cyclistic platform.</i> One way to do this is to require first-time casual riders to enter their e-mail before taking out a bike. 

This would allow us to track users as they progress from casual rider to annual member. 

Furthermore, notice that in May the number of casual weekend rides surpasses the number of weekend rides from annual members. In the winter, members ride more than casual riders (confirmed in the following sections).

# Tailor digital communications based on seasonal, hourly, and geospatial trends 

Whether the majority of conversions occur during the summer or not, it is evident from seasonal trends that most rides for casual and member customer types take place over the summer.

A digital media campaign (e.g. e-mail newsletter) can educate Cyclistic users of bike-friendly summer events (e.g. festivals, parks, etc), particularly near Navy Pier (one of Chicago's most popular tourist destinations). Navy Pier and recreational events along the coast should be highlighted given the popularity of Streeter & Grand Ave station, which is explained below.

Digital communications during winter would change to retain customer loyalty during winter months. These riders can be targeted based on geospatial location data as seen below.

## Segment the e-mail list based on geospatial data and number of rides per station

In order to increase the effectiveness of the campaign, we can target segments of customers. Based on geospatial data we identify two segments of bike stations for each customer type (casual rider vs annual member):

1. Group 1: Stations near the shore (e.g. Navy Pier, Michigan Ave, Millenium Park)
2. Group 2: Stations away away from the shore

The graph below shows the top 3 stations in number of casual riders:

<p align="center">
![](cyclisticreport_files/top3stations_casuals.png){width=70%}
</p>

Notice that Streeter Dr & Grand Ave dominates in total number of rides for casual riders. This station is near tourist sites like Navy Pier. Similarly, Michigan Ave and Millenium Park are popular tourist attractions. These fall under Group 1 for casual riders.

In the following geospatial graph of the top stations (in number of rides), each circle represents a station. The size of circles represents the amount of outgoing rides for a given station. 

Group 1, stations near the shore, are much more popular with casual riders

</p>

In contrast, see the top three stations for annual members:

<p align="center">
![](cyclisticreport_files/top3stations_members.png){width=70%}
</p>


The popularity of stations for customers who are annual members shifts away from the coast as seen below, where Group 2 is more dominant: 

<p align="center">
![](cyclisticreport_files/member_stations.png){width=70%}
</p>

Findings from geospatial data reveal the following trends:

1. Number of rides in Group 1 is higher for casual riders

2. Number of rides in Group 2 is higher for annual members

The top stations in Group 1 contain recreational areas (Navy Pier, Millenium Park, etc.) while stations in Group 2 contain a mix of commercial and tourist establishments.

The data suggests casual riders might join the platform for recreational reasons and continue to use their membership for work. More evidence is provided for this statement in the following section.

# Why do casual riders convert to annual members?

<b>Given the decrease in casual riders and slight increase in members over Jul-Sep months, as well as hourly and geospatial trends seen above, it seems casual riders join over the summer for recreational use and, when they subscribe, they maximize the benefits of their membership by riding to work.</b> This hypothesis should be validated with additional research (e.g. qualitative research).

When analyzing hourly data, we see a monthly increase in the use of bikes at 8AM and 5PM which suggests a tendency for annual members to use bikes during work hours, while casual riders lag in the increase of ridership during traditional work hours (see graph below).

# Track key performance metrics to maximize the effectiveness of digital campaign

With the current data, we can only keep track of number of rides. Assuming that is all we have, let's use <b> weekend and workday number of rides per customer type </b> to monitor the effectiveness of the campaign.

Based on the increased number of weekend rides for casual riders, local weekend events should be highlighted in digital communications to encourage more people to ride and  discover Chicago over the weekend.

This would allow us to target casual riders who registered the maximum number of rides on Saturdays. See graph below for trends in number of rides per day on a given weekday.

<p align="center">
![](cyclisticreport_files/figure-gfm/plot_rides_per_day-1.png){width=70%}
</p>

Hourly bike use should also be considered. Based on the graph below, which shows increased activity for members during (working) lunch hours, I also recommend a digital campaign that highlights the benefits of biking to work and grabbing a quick bite to eat.

<p align="center">
![](cyclisticreport_files/figure-gfm/plot_rides_tod-1.png){width=70%}
</p>
Notice the increase in activity during traditional workday hours 8AM and 5PM (08:00 and 17:00 hours in the graphs), and the slight uptick in rides during lunch hours. In contrast, hourly ride use becomes more evenly distributed over the weekend.

Therefore, <b>the key performance metrics are the number of rides per customer type based on geospatial groups, weekday vs workday, and time of day (e.g. lunch).</b>
 
# Additional insights on Cyclistic ride lengths

The mean workday ride length/duration for casual riders was approximately 24 minutes, and the median was ~14 minutes. In contrast, the mean workday ride duration for casual riders was ~29 minutes and the median was ~17 minutes. 

It should be noted, however, that the difference in median and mean values suggests the distribution for ride lengths is skewed positive and not normally distributed. 

The lack of a normal distribution for ride lengths should be noted if decision-makers decide to follow-up with rigorous statistical modeling. To provide preliminary insights, let's look at a visualization of casual riders and annual member distributions.

# Conclusions
The insights and recommendations presented here are supported by exploratory data analysis. By requiring casual users to register with e-mail, we can keep track of the user journey from casual use to annual membership.

Grouping the populations of casual riders and annual members based on geospatial and hourly trends allows us to target riders based on their current journey (recreational use vs workday use). 

The recommendations presented here provide summarized findings after data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. For the entire code, see finalcode.md.
