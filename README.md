# Actionable insights from ride-share data (cleaning, analysis, and visualization with R)
This project contains an in-depth analysis of the Cyclistic dataset (as part of the Google Capstone Data Analytics Project). Recommendations for the marketing department are provided in the final report. 

See <b>finalreport.md</b> for the entire cleaning, analysis, and visualization done in R Markdown.

## TLDR of finalreport.md
- The number of rides peak over the summer and decrease in the winter for both groups. However, patterns in ridership over the summer hint at casual riders converting to annual members during Jul-Sep months. <b>To confirm the strength of this trend, I recommend tracking user journeys from casual riders to annual members by monitoring conversions through e-mail or credit card numbers</b>. 

- I also propose a digital media marketing strategy based on a newsletter, which could be used to stimulate conversions over the summer and retain users during winter months. Furthermore, the number of rides per day for annual members is greatest during traditional work hours (8AM and 5PM Mon-Fri). However, casual riders seem to prefer weekends on the basis of number of rides per day. It's possible these casual riders convert over the summer, with leisure being a primary motivator (as mentioned by marketing documentation), and these annual members choose to maximize the benefits of their membership by riding to work. Tracking user journeys from casual riders to annual members would shed more light on this point.
